                Art, The creative side of me was forged through formal training for a smidgen under a decade in watercolors, oils and pencil sketching. Of the three main art skills, I enjoy pencil sketching the most and have been recently been dabbling in digital art. Here are few samples of my portfolio. <br>

                Running, having embraced running to manage stress of applying to grad school I would describe myself as an amateur runner at best who enjoys your weekly park runs, trails and treadmills. Here are some numbers I'm really proud of <br>

                Gifted with a naturally unatheletic frame and below average coordination, my passion for Motorsports is clearly justifiable. I'm a self confessed petrol head or gear head depending on which part of the world your from, with an unconditional liking for anything Motorsports or Formula 1. <br/>

                Some gear head opinions of mine : Senna is the greatest all time and my dream car is an E92 M3 coupe.
